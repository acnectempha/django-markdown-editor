Before we begin, I want to make it clear that this guide is for educational and entertainment purposes only. I do not condone or encourage the use of fake IDs for illegal or fraudulent activities. You are solely responsible for the consequences of your actions if you decide to use a fake ID. Also, this guide is based on the 2012 version of the US driver's licenses, which may have changed since then. You should always check the latest updates and requirements for the state you are trying to fake before making your ID.
 
## Step 1: Choose a State
 
The first step in making a fake ID is to choose a state that you want to fake. There are several factors to consider when choosing a state, such as the difficulty level, the availability of templates, the security features, and the popularity. Here are some tips to help you choose a state:
 
- Avoid states that have high security features, such as microprinting, UV ink, laser perforation, or raised text. These features are hard to replicate and may raise suspicion if not done properly.
- Avoid states that are very popular or common, such as California, New York, Florida, or Texas. These states are more likely to be checked and scrutinized by bouncers or authorities.
- Choose states that have simple designs and low security features, such as Arkansas, Connecticut, Delaware, or Idaho. These states are easier to fake and less likely to be noticed.
- Choose states that are close to your location or have similar demographics. This will make it more believable that you are from that state and reduce the chances of being questioned.

For this guide, I will use Delaware as an example state. You can choose any state you want, but make sure you do your research and find a suitable template for it.
 
## Step 2: Scan and Edit Your Photo
 
The next step is to scan and edit your photo for your fake ID. You will need a scanner, a photo editing software (such as Photoshop), and a color printer. Here are some tips to help you scan and edit your photo:

- Use a passport-style photo that shows your full face and shoulders against a plain white or light-colored background. Do not wear glasses, hats, or anything that covers your face or hair.
- Scan your photo at a high resolution (at least 300 dpi) and save it as a JPEG file.
- Open your photo in Photoshop and crop it to fit the size and shape of the photo area on your template. You can use the ruler tool or the crop tool to do this.
- Adjust the brightness, contrast, color balance, and sharpness of your photo to match the quality and tone of the template. You can use the image adjustment tools or filters to do this.
- Save your edited photo as a new JPEG file.

Here is an example of how I scanned and edited my photo for my Delaware fake ID:
